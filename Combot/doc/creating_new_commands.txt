Instructions for creating a new command GUI dialog with Combot
==============================================================

Examples for most of the features can be found in the example commands, located in Combot/Combot/src directory.

A command GUI is created by giving Combot a Command java object representing the command. This is done by providing a CommandFactory that creates the command. This is done by writing a java class implementing the factory interface.

The CommandFactory for the Unix find example command looks like this:

public class find implements CommandFactory {
    public Command make()
    {
        return new Command( "Find command", "find",
                    new FileArg( "Location", "", "/", FileOrDir.DIR, FileVal.ERROR_NOT_EXIST ),

                    new StringArg( "Name", "-name", "*" ),

                    new OptArg( false,
                        new CompositeArg( "Limit depth",
                            new IntArg( "Search depth", "-maxdepth", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 10 ) ) ),
                    new OptArg( false, new ExtraArg( "Extra arguments" ) ),

                    new AltArg( "Symbolic link treatment", 1, 10,
                            new ConstArg( "Never follow links", "-P" ),
                            new ConstArg( "Follow links", "-L" ),
                            new ConstArg( "Only follow links in args", "-H" ) )

        );
    }
}
