Cloning the repository, necessary steps
=======================================

git clone git@github.com:jensli/Combot.git
git submodule init
git submodule update

Explanation:
1) Using git to download a local copy of the repository (you probably need a Github account with an SSH public key for this)
2) Initiating the submodules, (i.e. the util repository that Combot uses)
3) Downloading the submodule


Importing into Eclipse
=======================

Import the Eclipse projects Combot and JavaUtilities, located in the parent Combot directory.
Run the j.combot.app.Main class.

Building with Ant
=================

Change location to Combot/Combot

Run command:
ant

If the standard JDK on your system is not JDK 7, follow instructions below to get it.  
Then run command:

JAVA_HOME=~/bin/jdk1.7.0/ ant


Running from command line
=========================

java -cp bin:../JavaUtilities/bin:lib/swt.jar:../JavaUtilities/lib/guava-10.0.1.jar j.combot.app.Main

If the standard JRE on your system is not JRE 7, follow instructions below to get it.  
Then run the java 

~/bin/jdk1.7.0/bin/java -cp bin:../JavaUtilities/bin:lib/swt.jar:../JavaUtilities/lib/guava-10.0.1.jar j.combot.app.Main


Downloading JDK 7
=================
On Linux, one good way of doing this without modifying you current Java installation:

Download the tar.gz version from here: www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u2-download-1377129.html

Unpack it to a arbitrary location of your choice (in this text, the location ~/bin/jdk1.7.0/ is used). This locations has to be specified when invoking java commands on the new JDK (e.g. java, javac, ant).

-------

On Windows, download one of the exe files, and run the installer.
